# Development Process Guidelines

## Implementation Approach

### Confirmation Before Implementation
**CRITICAL**: Always confirm the implementation approach with the user before proceeding with code changes.

#### Process:
1. **Analyze the request** - Understand what the user needs
2. **Propose the approach** - Outline the solution strategy, files to be modified, and key changes
3. **Wait for confirmation** - Get explicit approval before writing code
4. **Implement efficiently** - Execute the confirmed plan with minimal, focused changes

#### Example Confirmation Format:
```
I can implement [feature] by:
1. [Specific change 1] in [file]
2. [Specific change 2] in [file] 
3. [Any database/migration changes]

This approach will [brief explanation of outcome].

Should I proceed with this implementation?
```

### Benefits:
- Ensures alignment with user expectations
- Prevents unnecessary work or wrong direction
- Allows user input on technical decisions
- Maintains clear communication throughout development

### When to Skip Confirmation:
- Simple bug fixes or typos
- Explicitly requested specific implementations
- Emergency fixes where speed is critical
- User explicitly says to proceed without confirmation
